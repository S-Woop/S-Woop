👋 Hi, I’m Sean, also known as @S-Woop on GitHub.

👀 I’m interested in collaborating and learning about various aspects of the programming industry, with a particular focus on machine learning and developing intelligent systems. I'm intrigued by how these technologies can be applied in business, management, and enterprise architecture contexts.

🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals and advancing into intermediate levels across different programming domains. My primary focus is on Python, as I explore its applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. However, I have a broad interest in diverse programming paradigms and emerging technologies.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects spanning various domains within the programming landscape. While I have a keen interest in machine learning and intelligent systems, I'm open to contributing to diverse projects that leverage innovative technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible in programming. Whether it's web development, data analysis, or software engineering, I'm excited to explore new opportunities and contribute my skills to meaningful projects.

📫 You can reach me via email at seanwpwp@gmail.com. Let's connect and explore exciting opportunities together!
